##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I feel that base has to do with the general settings, layout has to do with size and positioning, and module is any additional changes and tweaks to elements further down the dom.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No refactoring of the CSS files, but index.html needed new links to the individual CSS files.
